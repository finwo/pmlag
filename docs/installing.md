Installing
----------

For now, there's no package managers that include the pmlag utility that we know
of.

You can either install pmlag from source by [compiling it
yourself](compiling.md), or by going to the
[edge](https://github.com/finwo/pmlag/releases/tag/edge) or
[stable](https://github.com/finwo/pmlag/releases/tag/stable) tag's page,
downloading it's precompiled package and following the instructions in the
package.
