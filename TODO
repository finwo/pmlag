mvp:
- start thread for every interface
- let thread create bond
- let thread create socket
- mutex all the things
- incoming on socket = send to master
- incoming on master = flood to slaves
balanced rr (a.k.a. spine-leaf-ish optimistic):
- set remainder to weight if remainder = 0 (and move to back of line)
- send packet and decrement remainder by 1
config reloading:
- listen to USR1 signal in parent thread
- update config
- create iface threads for new ifaces
- make thread close socket if not found in config
- make thread close bond if not found in config
spine-leaf-pessimistic:
- track seen mac addresses
- send only to interfaces where it was seen
- optionally send broadcast to all interfaces
- remove known mac address from interface if not seen for weight * 2 on interface
